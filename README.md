# Python-Basics

This repository explains the Python3 programming language basics which might be useful when taking Python-based datascience courses. Python is regarded as an object oriented language. Unlike Smalltalk, being a pure object oriented language, in Python you can ***escape*** to procedural or functional programming. In fact using `lambda` expressions is seen as functional. <br>
