    "# Operators\n",
    "Operator precedence describes the order in which operators are evaluated in a compound expression. In Python, operators have precedence. This table lists the Python operator precedence. The higher precedence operators are at the top, and the lower precedence at the bottom. In many cases, the order of these operators is obvious and follows the same rules as the math we learned in school. In other cases, they may not be so obvious. \n",
